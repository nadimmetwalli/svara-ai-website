      { name: "Henrik Lindqvist, Ops Director — Nordic Spa Resort", text: "SVARA's multilingual capabilities are a game-changer. Our guests call in Swedish, Finnish, English, and German — and the AI handles every language with ease. Our guest satisfaction scores have never been higher." },
      { name: "Ana Pereira, Revenue Manager — Lisbon Heritage Hotels", text: "We were losing bookings to OTAs simply because no one could answer the phone during peak check-in hours. SVARA recovered over €12,000 in direct bookings in our first month alone." },
    ],
    columnB: [
      { name: "James Whitfield, Owner — The Georgian House B&B", text: "As a small property, we can't staff a 24/7 reception. SVARA acts as our virtual concierge overnight — confirming reservations, answering amenity questions, and even booking restaurant tables for guests." },
      { name: "Sofia Andersson, Front Office Manager — Clarion Hotel", text: "The warm hand-off feature is brilliant. When a guest has a complex request, SVARA transfers them to our team with a full transcript. It feels completely seamless and our staff loves it." },
      { name: "Marco Bellini, Director — Tuscan Villa Collection", text: "I was skeptical about AI in luxury hospitality, but SVARA's tone is warm and professional. Our guests often don't realise they're speaking to an AI. It handles spa bookings, room upgrades, and concierge requests beautifully." },

    getInTouch: "Get in touch now and we can help you with all your queries right away",
    items: [
      { q: "How does SVARA AI integrate with my existing booking system?", a: "SVARA is designed to be ecosystem-agnostic. We use secure API bridges to connect directly with industry-leading Property Management Systems (PMS) like Mews, Oracle Opera, and Cloudbeds. This ensures that when SVARA confirms a booking or modifies a stay, your internal calendar is updated in real-time with zero manual data entry required from your staff." },
      { q: "Will the AI sound 'robotic' or frustrate my international guests?", a: "On the contrary, SVARA utilizes a high-fidelity streaming architecture that delivers near-zero latency and natural, human-like tonality. Our agent is natively multilingual, capable of switching between languages and understanding regional accents with ease. If a request becomes too complex, SVARA is programmed to perform a 'Warm Hand-off,' seamlessly transferring the guest to a human team member with a full transcript of the conversation so far." },
      { q: "Does SVARA replace my front-desk team?", a: "SVARA is built to empower your team, not replace them. By automating up to 70% of routine inquiries—such as booking confirmations, amenity FAQs, and restaurant reservations—SVARA removes the 'Administrative Burden' from your reception desk. This allows your talented staff to focus on providing high-touch, in-person hospitality to the guests standing right in front of them." },
      { q: "How do you ensure the security of our guests' private data?", a: "Trust is the foundation of hospitality. SVARA is fully GDPR-compliant, utilizing AES-256 encryption and EU-only data residency (Frankfurt/Stockholm). We employ 'PII Scrubbing' technology that automatically masks sensitive guest information in our logs, and we never store credit card details on our servers, passing them through secure, encrypted tunnels directly to your payment processor." },
      { q: "Can SVARA handle multiple languages?", a: "Yes! SVARA is designed to communicate in multiple languages, making it perfect for businesses operating in diverse markets across the Nordics, Baltics, and beyond." },
      { q: "Will I be able to see a report of how SVARA AI is doing?", a: "Absolutely. Our analytics dashboard gives you real-time insights on calls answered, revenue recovered, peak times, and customer requests." },
      { q: "How would you provide us with support, and do we need to pay for it?", a: "We provide 24/7 dedicated support at no extra cost. Our team is always available to help with setup, optimization, and any questions you may have." },
